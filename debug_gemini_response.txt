  "coverLetter": "February 8, 2026\n\nHiring Team at Lektor Aero\nLektor Aero\nHelsinki, Finland\n\nDear Hiring Team at Lektor Aero,\n\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Full Stack Developer position at Lektor Aero, as advertised on LinkedIn. I am deeply impressed by Lektor Aero's mission to provide certified training solutions for Air Traffic Control through cutting-edge educational technology, a field where my passion for robust software solutions and seamless user experiences can truly make an impact. My strong foundation in Full-Stack Development, coupled with hands-on proficiency in React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, aligns perfectly with your technical requirements and innovative spirit. I am eager to apply my Software Development principles and practices, along with a product mindset, to contribute to your global team.\n\nThe job description highlights the need to \"Build React UI flows and reusable components on Vite + Tailwind\" with \"Strong TypeScript across frontend.\" My project, Nimbus Weather Engine, directly reflects this expertise. In this endeavor, I architected and developed a production-grade weather dashboard utilizing Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, showcasing my proficiency in Front-End Development and component-based architecture. I meticulously integrated REST APIs to fetch and display real-time data and implemented dynamic UI backgrounds and advanced features, ensuring responsive design, accessibility, and optimized performance. This experience has equipped me to create the intuitive, high-performance web applications and seamless user experiences critical to Lektor Aero’s advanced training platforms.\n\nFurthermore, the role requires proficiency in \"Back-End Web Development\" and the ability to \"Design and implement NestJS APIs,\" working with \"Node.js\" and \"SQL/Prisma,\" and improving reliability with \"tests (Jest/Playwright) and monitoring (Sentry).\" While my most extensive professional experience to date is in front-end development, I possess a robust understanding of full-stack foundations and strong problem-solving skills derived from my academic background and project work with PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I am actively expanding my expertise in Node.js and am rigorously learning NestJS, Prisma, Docker, Kubernetes, Jest, Playwright, and Sentry. My commitment to manual implementation, clean code, and understanding fundamentals ensures that I can quickly acquire and apply these technologies to develop scalable back-end solutions and uphold the quality standards Lektor Aero is known for.\n\nLektor Aero's emphasis on a \"product mindset\" and \"collaborative delivery\" within a \"global team\" resonates strongly with my developer workflow. I leverage AI-assisted development tools for ideation and debugging, always with a strong emphasis on clean code and continuous improvement based on feedback. My experience working comfortably in English-based technical environments and international teams positions me to seamlessly integrate into your hybrid work model in Helsinki. I am particularly excited about the prospect of developing features into a 2D/3D simulation platform and contributing to the future of aviation and educational technology.\n\nI am confident that my blend of foundational full-stack skills, eagerness to learn and apply cutting-edge technologies, and dedication to delivering high-quality software makes me an ideal candidate for this role. Thank you for considering my application. I am very keen to discuss how my capabilities can benefit Lektor Aero in an interview.\n\nKind regards,\nWaruna Bandara Rathnamalala\nTampere, Finland\nEmail: warunaslfi@gmail.com\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/waruna-bandara\nGitHub: https://github.com/WarunaSLFI\nPortfolio: https://warunaslfi.com"
